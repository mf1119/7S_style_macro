# 7S_style_macro
Style conforming macro for Office Word for 7S manga style.   
Things it does:   
 - Numbers panel pages  
 - Numbers elements  
 - Formats pages, elements, notes, symbols, narration, and thoughts appropriately.   
 - Use backslash as escape for multi-line content. 
 - NEW!! -> Allows shorthand for speakers! 
    - Write KIRI {Kirishima} and future instances of "KIRI" in the selection will be replaced with "Kirishima". 
    - Note that this deletes the {Annotation}, so they will have to be readded if you use it again. 

Things it does NOT do:  
 - Replace ellipsis character with three periods: 'â€¦' -> '...'  
 - Replace em-dashes with two dashes  

These have to be done manually by find and replace. Sorry!
